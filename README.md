Customer Segmentation Analysis
Description
This project focuses on performing customer segmentation using clustering algorithms to identify different types of customers based on their purchasing behavior. Understanding these customer segments can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and retention.

Why Customer Segmentation?
Customer segmentation allows businesses to:

Target specific customer groups with personalized marketing efforts.
Develop focused retention strategies for high-value customers.
Better understand customer needs and preferences.
By applying clustering techniques, we can discover hidden patterns in customer data and group customers with similar behavior.

Tasks Performed
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Gathered and cleaned the dataset to ensure data quality.
Scaled and normalized data for better performance of clustering algorithms.
Clustering Algorithm Application:

Applied K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering to segment customers.
Used the Elbow method and dendrograms to identify the optimal number of clusters.
Cluster Analysis:

Analyzed each cluster to understand customer traits.
Generated insights on purchasing behavior for each segment.
Visualizations:

Visualized the clusters using scatter plots, dendrograms, and other relevant graphs.
Tech Stack
